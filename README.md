# SubstantialMemory I joined this class with a basic understanding of computer science and coding. I've taken an intro course on computer science at a college in the past. In this class, I look for direction on where to go with coding as I personally hate taking the time to look up various projects or courses on the subject. My knowledge on coding itself is pretty narrow and I hope that we will learn a lot more about it as we go on.
